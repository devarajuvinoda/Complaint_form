# Complaint_form
In this project I created a complaint form which takes input from user and also user can check the status of the complaint(whether resolved or not).
MYSQL was used for creating database whcih stores user information like, 
name, email, phone, complaint type, designation, department and description.
For creating webapp NodeJS, HTML and CSS was used.
